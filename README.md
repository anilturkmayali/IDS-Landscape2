# 🌐 IDS Landscape

**IDS Landscape** is an open, interactive visual map of the ecosystem surrounding the [International Data Spaces Association (IDSA)](https://internationaldataspaces.org). This project offers a structured overview of the key technologies, members, and collaborative initiatives within the IDS framework.

## 🎯 Purpose

The IDSA Landscape is designed to:
- Showcase core **technical solutions**, such as connectors and trust anchors
- Highlight **working groups**, **task forces**, and **implementation partners**
- Present a dynamic **directory of IDSA members**, categorized by country or sector
- Serve as a reference point for developers, adopters, policymakers, and researchers

## 📦 Key Categories

### 🧩 Connectors
A collection of certified and experimental connectors enabling trusted data exchange. These are sourced from the official [IDSA Data Connector Report](https://internationaldataspaces.org/publications/).

### 👥 Members
A comprehensive list of IDSA members, including corporations, research institutions, and public organizations—organized by country and region.

### 🧠 Working Groups & Task Forces
Active bodies within the IDSA community, collaborating on legal, technical, interoperability, and ethical dimensions of data spaces.

### 🚀 Use Cases & Projects *(coming soon)*
Examples of real-world implementations of IDS concepts, including EU-funded R&D projects, national initiatives, and industry pilots.

## 🛠️ Powered By
This project is built using [CNCF's Landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2), a static site generator that creates interactive visualizations from YAML-based definitions.
